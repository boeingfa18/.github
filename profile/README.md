## Hi there 👋

Welcome to **ObsoleteLabs**, a small organization that builds experimental tools, prototypes, and research projects. We keep our work light-hearted but focused on learning and sharing neat ideas.

### What we do
- Explore quick prototypes and proof-of-concepts.
- Share small utilities that others might find handy.
- Collaborate on learning exercises and research experiments.

### Getting involved
- Open an issue if you spot a bug or have an idea to try.
- Follow our repositories to see what we are experimenting with next.
- Be respectful and constructive—this is a collaborative space.

### Resources
- Check each repository README for setup and usage instructions.
- Issues often have context and links for ongoing work.

### Fun fact
Our team loves breakfast cereal and a strong cup of coffee to kick off a day of hacking.
